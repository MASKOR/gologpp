golog++ is an interfacing and development framework for GOLOG languages.
It employs a readable and typesafe GOLOG syntax that allows us to detect many common programming errors before any code is executed.
The fully object-oriented code model that does the static consistency checking is strictly separated from the runtime semantics and the platform backend.
The platform backend is an abstract C++ interface, making integration into any robotics framework staightforward and simple.
Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/MASKOR/gologpp/wiki) for a documentation of the language (WIP).
