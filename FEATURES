GologPP Features:

No compile-time dependency on implementation
-> Separate source trees, implementation depends on object model, NOT vice-versa

Parsing and AST instantiation also independent of implementation
  In fact, object model can be fully instantiatied even without an implementation being defined

Multiple, independent inheritance hierarchies governing syntactic & semantic (implementation) interfaces

Currently:
N robot platforms, M golog implementations -> N*M platform interfaces
With GologPP:
N GologPP-Platform interfaces + M GologPP implementations!
